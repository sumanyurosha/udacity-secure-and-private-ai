2. Read an article on analysing the Cricket World Cup 2019(https://medium.com/@arora.nishank91/analysing-cricket-world-cup-data-cd0af7cb1b11)

#Day 10:
8th July, 2019
1. Completed lesson 6 upto PATE Analysis.
2. Read the numpy documentation about all the functions used in lesson 6 from here(https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/index.html)

#Day 11:
9th July, 2019
1. Advanced in lesson 6 and looking to complete it by tomorrow.
2. Working on my first problem on Kaggle, on Titanic dataset. Approaching it first by applying binary classification and will then try to design more complex approaches to increase the accuracy. In next attempt will make a neural architecture for it.

#Day 12:
10th July, 2019
1. Completed lesson 6.
2.  Done with the pre-processing of the dataset of Titanic problem. Will be trying out different models on it tomorrow.
3. Link of problem: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

#Day 13:
11th July, 2019
1. Submitted my first problem on Kaggle and got 75% accuracy! Super excited for it. There is a lot of scope of improvement and will work on it.
2. Link to kernel(https://www.kaggle.com/sumanyurosha/kernelf82b9512ac)

#Day 14:
13th July, 2019
1. Working on PATE Analysis to understand it better.
2. Watched the video, Guest Interview: Privacy at Apple, and got to know how big players like Apple is making sense out of the customer data without impacting the privacy of their customers.
3. Formed a project group with Sourav Kumar, Labiba and Sabrina to work on Emotion Recognition project.

#Day 15:
